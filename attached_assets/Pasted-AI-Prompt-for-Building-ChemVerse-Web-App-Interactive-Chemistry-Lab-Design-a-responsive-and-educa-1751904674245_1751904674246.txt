AI Prompt for Building "ChemVerse" Web App (Interactive Chemistry Lab)
Design a responsive and educational web app called ChemVerse, built for students in grades 9‚Äì12 who lack access to physical chemistry labs. The interface must be modern, clean, intuitive, and visually engaging for high school students.

The goal is to allow students to explore the entire periodic table, mix elements, and learn the science behind reactions using AI-powered insights. The experience should feel fun, interactive, and educational ‚Äî not textbook-heavy.

üß™ Core Pages & Components:
1. Home Page
Hero section with a slogan like ‚ÄúExplore Chemistry, Anywhere.‚Äù

Button: ‚ÄúStart Experimenting‚Äù

Visual banner showing chemistry icons (flask, atoms, molecules)

Short section: ‚ÄúWhy ChemVerse?‚Äù with 3-4 illustrated benefits

Footer with About, Join Us, and Contact links

2. Periodic Table Interface Page
Full periodic table UI with 118 elements, accurately placed in blocks (s, p, d, f)

Color-coded by category (alkali metal, nonmetal, noble gas, etc.)

Hover tooltip: Element name, symbol, atomic number

Click interaction: opens sidebar or modal with full profile

Elements selectable to mix in a reaction

3. Mix Lab (Reaction Simulator Page)
Clean section showing selected elements

Button: ‚ÄúMix Elements‚Äù

Display result:

Compound name

Fun facts

Use cases

Small visual animation (if possible)

Optional: Add intensity meter or safety level meter

4. Element Details Modal/Sidebar
Name, symbol, atomic number, group, period

Physical properties (melting point, boiling point, etc.)

Real-world usage

Trivia or discovery fact

Visual icon or diagram

5. Knowledge Center (Learning Section)
Short lessons on:

Atomic structure

Types of reactions

Periodic trends

Small cards for each topic

Scrollable layout with illustrations and facts

6. Join Page
Call for volunteer developers or educators

Simple contact form

Clear note: ‚ÄúUnpaid voluntary collaboration‚Äù

üé® Design Style Instructions:
Color Palette:

Background: clean white/light gray

Category accents: blue, green, orange, red, pink (for element types)

CTA buttons: vibrant blue or green

Typography: Modern and readable (e.g., Poppins, Inter)

Card UI with rounded corners and icons

Friendly, soft shadows

Consistent iconography (science, chemistry, education)

üß† AI / Smart Features (Future Scope)
Sidebar AI assistant to explain reactions

Personalized recommendations based on reactions done

Molecule visualizer (3D in later versions)

Login system for progress tracking

‚úÖ Functional Notes:
Fully responsive for desktop, tablet, mobile

Clean animations (e.g., element fades, card slide-ins)

Accessibility: high contrast, keyboard navigable, alt text

Future API integration ready (OpenAI or Chem APIs)
