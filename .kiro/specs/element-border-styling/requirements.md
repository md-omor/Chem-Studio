# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements category-specific border-radius styling for periodic table elements to enhance visual differentiation and create a more polished, professional appearance. The styling will apply conditional border-radius based on element category and specific filtering rules for certain periods and groups.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing the periodic table, I want elements to have distinctive border styling based on their chemical categories, so that I can quickly identify different element types through visual cues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the periodic table is displayed THEN all elements SHALL have no default border-radius
2. WHEN an element belongs to a specific category THEN the system SHALL apply category-specific border-radius styling
3. WHEN multiple elements of the same category are displayed THEN they SHALL have consistent border styling within their category rules

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want reactive nonmetal elements to have distinctive corner styling, so that I can easily distinguish them from other element categories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a reactive nonmetal element is displayed THEN the system SHALL apply border-radius to the bottom-right corner only
2. WHEN the reactive nonmetal category includes halogen elements THEN they SHALL follow the same bottom-right corner border-radius rule

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want alkali metal elements to have specific border styling with exceptions, so that I can visually distinguish them while accounting for special cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an alkali metal element is displayed THEN the system SHALL apply border-radius to the bottom-right corner only
2. WHEN the element is Francium (Fr) THEN the system SHALL NOT apply any border-radius
3. WHEN other alkali metals are displayed THEN they SHALL have bottom-right corner border-radius

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want alkaline earth metal elements to have consistent border styling with exceptions, so that I can identify them visually while handling special cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an alkaline earth metal element is displayed THEN the system SHALL apply border-radius to the bottom-right corner only
2. WHEN the element is Francium (Fr) THEN the system SHALL NOT apply any border-radius
3. WHEN other alkaline earth metals are displayed THEN they SHALL have bottom-right corner border-radius

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want transition metal elements to have period-specific border styling, so that I can distinguish between different periods of transition metals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transition metal element from periods 1-6 is displayed THEN the system SHALL apply border-radius to the bottom-right corner only
2. WHEN a transition metal element is from period 7 AND is one of ["Fr", "Db", "Sg", "Bh", "Hs"] THEN the system SHALL NOT apply any border-radius
3. WHEN other period 7 transition metals are displayed THEN they SHALL have bottom-right corner border-radius

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want post-transition metal elements to have filtered border styling, so that I can identify them with appropriate visual exceptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a post-transition metal element is displayed THEN the system SHALL apply border-radius to the bottom-right corner only
2. WHEN the element is Polonium (Po) OR Copernicium (Cn) THEN the system SHALL NOT apply any border-radius
3. WHEN the element is from period 6 group 16 THEN the system SHALL apply square-type border-radius
4. WHEN the element is from period 7 group 12 THEN the system SHALL NOT apply any border-radius

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want metalloid elements to have period and group specific border styling, so that I can distinguish them with appropriate visual filtering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a metalloid element is displayed THEN the system SHALL apply border-radius to the bottom-right corner only
2. WHEN the element is Astatine (At) THEN the system SHALL NOT apply any border-radius
3. WHEN the element is from period 6 group 17 THEN the system SHALL apply square-type border-radius

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want noble gas elements to have period and group specific border styling, so that I can identify them with appropriate visual filtering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a noble gas element is displayed THEN the system SHALL apply border-radius to the bottom-right corner only
2. WHEN the element is Radon (Rn) THEN the system SHALL NOT apply any border-radius
3. WHEN the element is from period 6 group 18 THEN the system SHALL apply square-type border-radius

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the border styling system to be maintainable and performant, so that the styling logic is easy to understand and doesn't impact application performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the border styling logic is implemented THEN it SHALL use efficient filtering and conditional logic
2. WHEN an element's styling is calculated THEN the system SHALL determine the appropriate border-radius in a single function call
3. WHEN the styling rules are modified THEN they SHALL be easily configurable without affecting other styling aspects
