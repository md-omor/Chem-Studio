# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds origin classification to chemical elements in the periodic table, categorizing each element as Primordial, From decay, or Synthetic based on their natural occurrence and discovery method. This classification helps users understand how elements exist in nature and provides educational value about element stability and formation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a chemistry student, I want to see the origin classification of each element, so that I can understand whether elements occur naturally or are artificially created.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing an element card THEN the system SHALL display the element's origin classification (Primordial, From decay, or Synthetic)
2. WHEN hovering over the origin classification THEN the system SHALL show a tooltip explaining what each classification means
3. WHEN filtering elements THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by origin classification

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an educator, I want elements to be visually distinguished by their origin, so that I can easily demonstrate the difference between natural and artificial elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the periodic table THEN the system SHALL display a visual indicator for each origin type
2. WHEN viewing the element legend THEN the system SHALL include origin classification symbols
3. WHEN an element has synthetic origin THEN the system SHALL display it with a distinct visual marker

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want accurate origin data for all 118 elements, so that I can rely on the information for educational purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing element data THEN the system SHALL provide correct origin classification for all 118 elements
2. WHEN an element's classification is "Primordial" THEN it SHALL represent elements that have existed since Earth's formation
3. WHEN an element's classification is "From decay" THEN it SHALL represent elements that occur naturally through radioactive decay
4. WHEN an element's classification is "Synthetic" THEN it SHALL represent elements created artificially in laboratories
