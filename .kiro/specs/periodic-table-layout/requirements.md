# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on implementing the correct periodic table layout with proper element positioning. The periodic table should display all elements in their scientifically accurate positions using an 18-column by 7-row main grid, with lanthanides and actinides displayed separately below the main table.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a chemistry student, I want to see elements positioned in their correct periodic table locations, so that I can understand the relationships between elements and their properties.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the periodic table loads THEN the system SHALL display elements in an 18-column grid layout
2. WHEN the periodic table loads THEN the system SHALL display elements in 7 main rows for periods 1-7
3. WHEN the periodic table loads THEN the system SHALL position hydrogen (H) in column 1, row 1
4. WHEN the periodic table loads THEN the system SHALL position helium (He) in column 18, row 1
5. WHEN the periodic table loads THEN the system SHALL leave appropriate gaps for elements that don't exist in certain positions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a chemistry educator, I want lanthanides and actinides displayed separately below the main table, so that the table maintains its traditional compact format while showing all elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the periodic table displays lanthanides THEN the system SHALL position them in a separate row below the main table
2. WHEN the periodic table displays actinides THEN the system SHALL position them in a separate row below the lanthanides
3. WHEN the main table shows periods 6 and 7 THEN the system SHALL display placeholder indicators for lanthanide and actinide series
4. WHEN lanthanide elements (57-71) are displayed THEN the system SHALL position them in columns 1-15 of the lanthanide row
5. WHEN actinide elements (89-103) are displayed THEN the system SHALL position them in columns 1-15 of the actinide row

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user viewing the periodic table, I want proper spacing and visual gaps where elements don't exist, so that I can clearly see the natural groupings and patterns in the periodic table.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN period 1 displays THEN the system SHALL show only hydrogen in column 1 and helium in column 18
2. WHEN period 2 displays THEN the system SHALL show elements in columns 1-2 and 13-18 only
3. WHEN period 3 displays THEN the system SHALL show elements in columns 1-2 and 13-18 only
4. WHEN periods 4-7 display THEN the system SHALL show elements in their correct group positions
5. WHEN displaying any period THEN the system SHALL leave empty spaces where no elements exist

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the periodic table, I want all existing functionality to work correctly with the new layout, so that I can continue to select elements and view their details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on any element THEN the system SHALL display the element modal with detailed information
2. WHEN I select elements for mixing THEN the system SHALL maintain the selection functionality
3. WHEN elements are selected THEN the system SHALL display visual indicators on the selected elements
4. WHEN I hover over elements THEN the system SHALL show hover effects and interaction hints
5. WHEN the table is responsive THEN the system SHALL maintain proper layout on different screen sizes
