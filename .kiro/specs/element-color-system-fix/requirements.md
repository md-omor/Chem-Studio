# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current element color system has inconsistencies that cause `colorHex` to be undefined in the ElementCard component. There are two separate color systems - one using hex colors in the storage layer and another using Tailwind CSS classes in the UI components. This needs to be unified into a single, consistent color system that properly displays element category colors throughout the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing the periodic table, I want each element to display with its correct category color, so that I can visually distinguish between different element categories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an element is displayed in the ElementCard component THEN it SHALL show the correct color based on its category
2. WHEN the colorHex property is accessed THEN it SHALL never be undefined
3. WHEN elements are loaded from storage THEN they SHALL have valid colorHex values assigned

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want a single source of truth for element category colors, so that color changes are consistent across the entire application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN element category colors are defined THEN they SHALL be stored in one centralized location
2. WHEN colors are updated THEN the changes SHALL be reflected in all components that use element colors
3. WHEN new element categories are added THEN they SHALL automatically receive appropriate colors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the element colors to be consistent between the periodic table grid and individual element cards, so that the visual experience is cohesive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an element is displayed in the periodic table grid THEN it SHALL use the same color as in the element card
2. WHEN element badges are shown in the selected elements section THEN they SHALL use the same colors as the periodic table
3. WHEN element colors are displayed THEN they SHALL have sufficient contrast for accessibility

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the color system to handle edge cases gracefully, so that the application doesn't break when encountering unknown or missing element categories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an element has an unknown category THEN it SHALL display with a default fallback color
2. WHEN colorHex is missing or null THEN the system SHALL provide a sensible default
3. WHEN the color system encounters errors THEN it SHALL not crash the application
