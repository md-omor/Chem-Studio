- [ ] 6. Update client-side error handling and user feedback

  - Enhance AI chat modal to display better error messages
  - Add loading states that indicate retry attempts
  - Implement automatic retry indicators in the UI
  - Update error messages to be more informative and actionable
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4_

- [ ] 7. Add comprehensive logging for AI service operations

  - Implement detailed request/response logging with timing
  - Add fallback activation logging with context
  - Create error categorization and reporting system
  - Add recovery event logging when services come back online
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 8. Create integration tests for resilience scenarios
  - Write tests that simulate AI service failures
  - Test retry logic with various error conditions
  - Verify fallback content delivery when AI is unavailable
  - Test automatic recovery when services become available again
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 4.3, 4.4_
