# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ChemVerse application is experiencing intermittent AI service connection errors when using free OpenRouter models, particularly the Meta Llama 3.1 405B free model. These errors occur due to high demand on free models, rate limiting, and temporary service unavailability. This feature will implement robust error handling, retry mechanisms, and fallback strategies to provide a more reliable user experience when AI services are under stress.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of the ChemVerse app, I want the AI assistant to work reliably even when free models are experiencing high demand, so that I can continue learning chemistry without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a free model is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL automatically try alternative free models
2. WHEN all primary free models fail THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
3. WHEN retries are exhausted THEN the system SHALL provide a helpful error message explaining the situation
4. WHEN the AI service recovers THEN the system SHALL resume normal operation without user intervention

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear and helpful error messages when AI services are unavailable, so that I understand what's happening and what I can do about it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI service is experiencing high demand THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly message explaining the temporary nature of the issue
2. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL inform the user about free model limitations and suggest waiting
3. WHEN all AI models fail THEN the system SHALL provide fallback educational content where possible
4. WHEN displaying error messages THEN the system SHALL include estimated recovery time when available

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI service to gracefully degrade when models are unavailable, so that the application remains functional even during AI service outages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide cached or static educational content as fallback
2. WHEN chemical reaction analysis fails THEN the system SHALL return basic compound information from local data
3. WHEN element explanations fail THEN the system SHALL provide basic element properties from the periodic table data
4. WHEN the chat assistant fails THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative resources or common chemistry topics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically recover from temporary AI service issues, so that I don't have to manually retry or refresh the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI request fails due to temporary issues THEN the system SHALL automatically retry with exponential backoff
2. WHEN multiple models are available THEN the system SHALL try them in order of preference
3. WHEN a model becomes available again THEN the system SHALL resume using it without user action
4. WHEN implementing retries THEN the system SHALL limit total retry time to prevent indefinite waiting

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring of AI service health, so that I can understand usage patterns and optimize the service configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI requests are made THEN the system SHALL log response times and success rates
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including model and error type
3. WHEN fallback mechanisms activate THEN the system SHALL log which fallbacks were used
4. WHEN models recover THEN the system SHALL log recovery events and timing
